# Configuration for the chest item ratios
# this system works by levels. Level 1 aka lvl1 
# is the most common stuff whereas lvl5 is the least 
# common. You can set what will spawn at each level below.
# The ratio setting determines how likley the next level is
# to spawn in. a ratio of 2 means that it is twice as unlikley
# for the next level to spawn in.

# <item_name>,<max amount per slot>
